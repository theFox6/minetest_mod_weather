# Snow covers ABM
#
# The "fast computer snow covers ABM” controls if snow covers
# will be placed on the ground when `weather:snow` is set.
# This needs a better computer and should not be used if the
# performance drops too much. It is disabled by default.

# Raycast hitcheck
#
# The "fast computer raycast hitcheck" controls if raycasts are
# used to check if the player is affected by the downfall instead
# of checking the lighting. If disabled the checks are already
# very accurate because the sunlevel light can only be reached
# without nodes nearby. Checking the light also works at night.
# The raycasts only effect is that they also check the wind
# direction. This might cause the performance to drop though.
